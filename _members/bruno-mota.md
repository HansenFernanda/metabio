The boss!

<!-- Bruno Mota from the Instituto de Física at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. Bruno holds BA and MA degrees in physics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG – Brazil), and a PhD in Cosmology from the Brazilian Center for Physics Research (CBPF). While working on his thesis about ‘Detection and detectability of Cosmic Topology’ he collaborated with Prof. Suzana Herculano-Houzel (UFRJ, now Vanderbilt U.) on mathematical models for cellular composition in brains, and went on to work as a postdoctoral researcher in her lab. What was supposed to be a brief interdisciplinary excursion eventually became his main research focus, and he was hired as a professor at the Physics Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in 2013. His main focus currently is creating and testing models to understand the shape of the brain from first physical and evolutionary principles. He heads the metaBIO lab (‘Experimental Mathematics and Theoretical Biology) and is a Serrapilheira grantee, cook and cyclist.Bruno Mota from the Instituto de Física at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

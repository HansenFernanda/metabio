Hello, you probably got here from the QR code on our OHBM2022 poster. Welcome! If not, you are welcome too :D

Here we present the Supplementary Information for the work “Exploring the limits of a Universal Cortical Folding Model: an application to Congenital Pathologies” from Fernanda Hansen P. de Moraes[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2], Caroline Victorino Felix de Lima[^1], Victor B. B. Mello[^2], Patricia Soares de Oliveira-Szejnfeld[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^3], Arnaldo Prata-Barbosa[^4], Leighton Hinkley[^5], Elliot Sherr[^5], Lynn K. Paul[^6], Fernanda Tovar-Moll[^1], Bruno Mota[^2].

We want to include some additional information regarding the presented research. This will be divided into topics: 1) Previous findings by applying the cortical folding rule in humans; 2) Description of Corpus Callosum Dysgenesis and Zyka Congenital Syndrom; 3) Simulated data used; and 4) Limitations.

# Previous findings by applying the cortical folding rule in humans (giving the context of what we know by far)
under construction

# Description of Corpus Callosum Dysgenesis and Zyka Congenital Syndrom
under construction

# Simulated data used
We simulated data using subjects below 30 years from (de Moraes 2021; Wang et al. 2019),  a subsample of the Baby Connectome Project (BCP) (Howell et al. 2019), and 34 CNT participants who fitted this condition. We generated 10000 data points of A<sub>T</sub>, A<sub>E</sub>, and T a covariance matrix of A<sub>T</sub>, A<sub>E</sub>, T, and Age to account for the dependence within those variables. We further filtered the generated data to the age range of the ZK and MICRO groups (2; 3.1 years old) (Table 1).

| Sample       | N    | Age ± SD (range)       |
|--------------|------|------------------------|
| AHEAD        | 1    | 24 ± 0 (24)            |
| AOMIC PIOP 1 | 208  | 22 ± 1.8 (18; 26)      |
| BCP          | 33   | 1.7 ± 0.68 (0.92; 4.7) |
| CALTECH      | 17   | 23 ± 2.9 (19; 29)      |
| IDOR-CCD     | 5    | 11 ± 3.1 (7; 16)       |
| UCSF         | 12   | 23 ± 3.1 (19; 28)      |
| Simulated    | 1156 | 3  ± 0.58 (2; 4)       |

To ensure the simulated data was adequate, we applied the cortical folding model. The simulated data fitted the linear model with R<sup>2</sup> = 0.87, p < 0.0001 and self-similarity exponent of 1.25 (95% CI 1.23; 1.28) (Figure 1).

The blue line represents the linear regression of the simulated data, while the red line is the linear regression of true data used as a reference for the simulation, and the dashed red lines represent the confidence interval of the true regression._

# Limitations
We intended here to provide preliminary results from an incipient study relating congenital pathologies and cortical folding. Thus we still have some limitations to overcome.

Due to the inherent characteristics of these pathologies that might lead to extreme alterations in brain structure, our image processing pipeline is not optimal[^7]. To overcome this limitation, and not include more uncertainties due to manually correcting surfaces from all subjects (including the ones that it was not necessary), we intend to correct subjects under the supervision of an experient radiologist, and only those with extensive surface errors. Also, without the correction, the surfaces could disguise differences, for example, between DCC types, as it might not have been sensible enough to the anatomical differences across our heterogenic sample. The processing limitation is also true for the BCP sample, in which only a subsample is processed and went under visual inspection. We expect to include all subjects from the sample in future presentations of this study. 

Our second main limitation is related to the simulated sample. We simulated data using linear functions of T, A<sub>T</sub>, A<sub>E</sub> extracted from 0 to 30 years old, including them, adults. This is probably not the optimal methodology, but the one workable within this context and sample size. We expect to improve those linear functions by including more subjects, as an expansion of our previous work (de Moraes et al. 2022).

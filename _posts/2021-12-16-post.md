Our PhD student, [Kamilla Souza](kamilla-souza) will be participatibg at the [Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB)](https://burkclients.com/sicb/meetings/2022/site/) meeting in 2022, Phoenix, Arizona, USA. She will present Tuesday (04/01/2022) the entire work (poster P1-101): Multiparametric Comparative Analysis on Structure and Cellular Composition of Cetacean Brains.

Here is a brief video created by Heitor, a co-author of Kamilla’s poster. It’s a comparison of an old 3D model reconstruction with ours newer and more accurate one.
